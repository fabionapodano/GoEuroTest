This is an universal app, so it runs on iPod, iPhone and iPad with iOS6 and above.

SBJSON library (.a included) is used to decode JSON data.

I think that the code is self-explanatory, thanks to verbose variable and method names. 

The SBJSON library has been compiled to work on iOS simulator too, and there is a GPX file loaded in the options for location simulation, so the project can also be ran in iOS simulator.
